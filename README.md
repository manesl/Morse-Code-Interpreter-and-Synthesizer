Files:

* main.c: This file consists of two paths/sections: 1) text to morse 2) morse to text. We used a single switch, atmega32, and speaker for the main operation. Additional buttons for making it a little user-friendly. 

* A video file consist of first part text to morse sound, when we press buttons on the keypad to hear the sounds. This can serve as a training mode for the disabled. The second part is morse to text, with single press of the button, we can ouput text on the LCD screen.
